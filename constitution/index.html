          <h4>Preamble</h4>
          <p>
            We, the School of Computer Science (SCS) Master’s students at
            Carnegie Mellon University, establish this committee formally in
            order to ensure the betterment of aforementioned student life during
            our time here and beyond by spearheading initiatives and providing
            feedback to the Dean of Computer Science.
          </p>

          <h4>ARTICLE I. PURPOSE</h4>
          <p>
            This organization was created in order to better student life in
            three dimensions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Quality of personal experience for master’s students, which can be
              subdivided into
            </li>
            <ul class="plus">
              <li>Mental Health</li>
              <li>Resources available and knowledge thereof</li>
              <li>Culture and Atmosphere</li>
              <li>Clear bidirectional communication with every student</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              School of Computer Science issues which are broad and encompassing
              (and affect master’s students but may be broader)
            </li>
            <li>
              Increasing academic diffusion by encouraging cross collaboration
              and reducing siloing
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>ARTICLE II. SCOPE OF WORK</h4>
          <p>
            In order to achieve the purpose set forth in Article I, this
            committee will work within the following confines
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              This organization will operate at the SCS level or broader (i.e.
              department level issues are not in its purview).
            </li>
            <li>
              The issues heard and policies considered must affect more than a
              single student or any group of students that has a governing body.
              <br /><i
                >For example, issues within the Language Technologies Institute
                (LTI) should go through the LTI administration, but issues
                affecting certain students from LTI, Robotics, and Computational
                Biology will be addressed by this committee since there is no
                single administration before SCS.</i
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              This organization will aid information flow to students to allow
              for better resource allocation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The issues must affect Master’s students in SCS, but can affect
              others as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              As previously implied, broader issues than the aforementioned will
              be considered as well.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>ARTICLE III. Organizational Structure and Membership:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Organizational Structure </strong><br />The organizational
              structure for the committee consists of the following roles of
              responsibility to allow for more effective execution and action.

              <ul class="plus">
                <li>
                  <strong class="low-intensity">Liaison for the Dean </strong
                  ><br />
                  Serves as main communicator and point of contact with the
                  administration; generally guides committee in accordance with
                  large goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong class="low-intensity">Secretary</strong> <br />
                  Acts as the main internal point of contact and also informs
                  others of progress. The secretary shall also maintain a member
                  list, with a contact sheet, and keep meeting minutes as
                  necessary to ensure that all have a collective understanding
                  of occurrences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong class="low-intensity">
                    Ad Hoc committee manager
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  Fosters the creation of temporary work teams for various
                  projects. These ad hoc committees are often formed to work on
                  a particular item of interest as brought up at the meetings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong class="low-intensity"> Media Mogul </strong>
                  <br />Maintains social media channels, gathers student
                  opinions, performs internal outreach, and performs general
                  external outreach.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Roles will be chosen based on a nomination process. The nomination
              will happen upon a current role holding member leaving or being
              removed. This must happen after the new members have joined the
              committee. The nomination will consist of :
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A self-nomination screening to determine the initial applicant
                  pool
                </li>
                <li>
                  If more than one member nominated per position, there will be
                  a vote where each member of the committee will have two votes
                  (one if only two candidates) per position up for nomination.
                  The person with the most votes will secure the nomination.
                </li>
              </ol>
              Each member with a role of responsibility above can be removed
              from the position or committee with the approval/initiative of the
              SCS Dean’s Office. For approval any other member in a role of
              responsibility or a majority of the committee can choose to bring
              this up to the administration.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>
                Membership Selection Process / Composition of Org
              </strong>
              <br />
              The committee will be of a size such that there is representation
              from each category of master’s programs while simultaneously
              ensuring a diverse representative body and representation from
              each department. The category axes of master’s programs are:
              <ul class="plus">
                <li>Research v. Professional (Type)</li>
                <li>Large v. Small (Size)</li>
                <li>Bridge Programs (e.g. MSPM, MSCB, MITS)</li>
              </ul>

              As aforementioned, the committee will also have diversity and
              representation targets to ensure that there is an appropriate
              composition. These will be along the axes of gender, race, student
              status (international or domestic), and ideology. These are soft
              targets that are to encourage diversity and are flexible as
              opposed to forcing a perhaps ill-fitting or impractical rule.
              There will be a final vetting process by the Dean’s office where
              the requirements can be softly waived.

              <p class="tab">
                The selection process will include both a nomination process and
                recommendations in parallel. The recommendations from current
                members must be from within that member’s department.
                Additionally, preference is given to current members, unless
                otherwise noted by the Dean’s Office. The self nomination form
                will be released in both October and March as necessary to
                ensure complete membership such that the axes listed above are
                approximately filled.
                <br />
                For those who volunteer to join the committee, the committee
                will evaluate each volunteer on a case by case basis while
                considering the aforementioned axes. In addition, there will be
                a cap such that the size of the committee shall not exceed two
                times the number of programs as an upper bound.
              </p>

              Every new member will undergo an apprenticeship period where for
              the first semester after joining, regardless of method of joining,
              the new member will be considered an apprentice. Apprentices will
              not have voting rights for roles and constitution changes.
              Additionally, they are unable to hold roles themselves. This is
              done to create a formal onramp period as well as increase the
              likelihood that full members are active participants.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Rules of Membership </strong><br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  All members should actively participate in meetings at least
                  once a month during the semester to retain
                  voting/recommendation rights. If two months of absence elapse
                  without extenuating circumstances, that member is removed from
                  the committee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The meetings with the Dean are mandatory for those who signal
                  that they are available (i.e. if a member RSVPs as attending
                  for the Dean’s meetings, they need to attend unless
                  extenuating circumstances arise). If the meeting must be
                  missed at the last minute, then the secretary or liaison must
                  be informed.
                </li>
                <li>Membership is until graduation or resignation</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <br />

            <li>
              <strong> Practicalities (Meeting times, methods, etc) </strong
              ><br />
              Meetings will be held once a week and default to 15 minutes, but
              are extensible given the inevitable variable workloads of
              meetings. These meetings are used to brainstorm ideas, determine
              next steps, and update the group.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Amendment process for constitution:</h4>
          <p>
            At least 60% of active members (those who choose to vote) need to
            agree on changes to this document. Amendments will be proposed two
            weeks before the vote. All amendments are subject to final approval
            by the Dean’s Office.
